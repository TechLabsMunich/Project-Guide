The following tools should make it easier for you to work together
- Trello: Use it to define goals and tasks and responsibilities (https://trello.com/home)
- Git resp. Github: in consultation with your mentor and the Techlabs team, an official Techlabs project repo where you can work together on your code and version it with git - just like real software development. (https://github.com/)

## Integrated Development Environment (the place where to do the coding)
We recommend to use the following
- R Studio for R: https://www.rstudio.com/

## More Information
Take some time to search for for smaller examples that are already publicly available on Github, so you can get a quick first overview of how different problems could be solved.
